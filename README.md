awsserver start|stop|status|ssh [username]

- `awsserver start` starts the server
- `awsserver stop` stops the server
- `awsserver status` check is server is running
- `awsserver ssh <username>` ssh into your server


Operate an instance in your AWS VPC with pre-defined launch configuration and attach a public IP address.
To ssh to the instance use "awsserver ssh" - this assumes that you have already set up your keys.
