awsserver start|stop|status|ssh [username]

```awsserver start
Starts server


Start/stop an instance in your AWS VPC with pre-defined launch configuration and attach a public IP address.
To check status use "awsserver status".
To ssh to the instance use "awsserver ssh" - this assumes that you have already set up your keys.
